      <title>AI breaks the game of hide and seek</title>

      <description>This is a really fun video where an AI is given a version of the game of hide and seek and each team has to learn ways to win - either by finding the other team or by not being found.
Over time they develop and adapt to each others strategies including having to work as a team to win. They also find ways to break the expected rules including finding actual issues with the modelling of the environment.</description>

      <title>Questions to ask yourself before you buy</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/pausingbeforebuying/</link>

      <description>Sometimes it is very easy to buy things just for the sake of it. We get that rush when either we bring the item home or it is delivered. It is easy to form an addiction to that feeling.
When the sales come around we might see something on offer that we think we would like - but had probably not considered before - and this is the time to take a step back and consider whether we really need it.</description>

      <title>Exposing the beauty in a problem</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/beautyinaproblem/</link>

      <description>I was recently reminded of this great quote:
&amp;ldquo;When I&amp;rsquo;m working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.&amp;rdquo; - R. Buckminster Fuller
Sometimes this happens when working in the world of software.
There have been occasions where I have been working on a design and the solution just seems to fall out almost naturally - and in most cases where this has happened the beauty becomes apparent in the ease and clarity that the approach can be built on and extended.</description>

      <description>There is a famous quote that asks how you eat an elephant and the answer is one bite at a time. It can be very daunting when attempting something new especially if it is potentially a large task. However it is impossible if you don&amp;rsquo;t take the first step.
(By the way, I am not advocating eating elephants - just to be clear)

      <title>How behaviour can shape the culture</title>

      <description>Andrew Cherrie is the pastor of Home Church. In a recent sermon entitled &amp;ldquo;7 lessons from 7 years at Home Church&amp;rdquo; he gave the following quote:
The culture is shaped by the worst behaviour the leader is willing to accept
He was particularly referencing the church however it is much broader than this.
This observation has certainly shown to be the case where I have worked. Without wanting to incriminate myself, there have been some questionable decisions made by the management in the past which have meant it has been very difficult to hold others accountable for their later actions when a precedence has been set.</description>

      <title>Solitude and conversations lead to great ideas</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/solitudeandconversation/</link>

      <guid>https://ilearnt.com/post/solitudeandconversation/</guid>
      <description>There was a tweet recently by Sahil Lavingia that stated
&amp;ldquo;Great ideas come from two places: solitude and conversation.&amp;quot;
I have certainly found this to be the case.
When I was commuting into London every day I would regularly spend 30 minutes walking back from the train station. During this time I would either listen to podcasts - all sorts of subjects - or just use the time to think. This led to a whole bunch of ideas around work or potential projects or just interesting avenues to follow.</description>

      <title>A first encounter with sketchnoting</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/sketchnoting/</link>

      <description>One of the talks I attended at the Microsoft Build conference was called &amp;ldquo;Sketchnoting 101&amp;rdquo; and given by Nitya Narasimhan. It gave a very high level view of the approach and how anyone can quickly pick it up.
Having seen the rough approach I think I have a preference for trying it electronically as it means I can make corrections and play around with layouts. It seems that the most common tool for this is Procreate however this unfortunately is limited to the Apple ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Whenever I work I am always jotting down things on pieces of plain paper next to me - this could be things to do, ideas, random thoughts, planning for meetings, etc.. Every week or so I do a cull of this stack of paper and then start on a new piece of paper.
Recently I bought a small whiteboard for my daughter which she uses to plan her schoolwork. It seemed to work very well for her so I thought I would give it a try.</description>

      <title>Finally a to-do app I use ... Microsoft To Do</title>

      <description>I have tried numerous to-do applications in the past; from the very simplest to the all-singing, all-dancing applications and they have never stuck. I used them for a week or so and realised a month later that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used them for a while.
The Microsoft To Do application seems to have hit a sweet spot for me. I have found myself using it regularly to track both my home and my work tasks.</description>

      <description>Someone I work with mentioned that each week he takes time to have coffee with his mum. This might sound quite normal but there are two parts that stand out for me.
Firstly it is the actual act of scheduling time to do this. It is very easy in today&amp;rsquo;s world to get so busy that we forget about the important stuff. Secondly, he lives in London and his mum lives in South Africa.</description>

      <description>This is one of the scariest videos I think I have ever seen. It is not a horror movie or a thriller - it is a talk about the impact sleep has on the body and in particular the impact a lack of sleep has. This includes increasing the risk of cancer, decreased brain function and reduced immune system. I am seriously reconsidering how I &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; sleep after watching this!</description>

      <description>I read a lot of books - a bit less at the moment as I commute less - but still probably more than most people. However there are so many books I would like to read I can&amp;rsquo;t read them all. I still prefer to read the full book but sometimes book summaries are useful - either to get the key concepts or as a reminder of what I have previously read.</description>

      <description>I really like Seth Godin&amp;rsquo;s blog - I could easily link to his posts every day - however occasionally a post really stands out for me. A recent post called Bottlenecks had an interesting observation that was a different way of thinking about them.
I worked for a company a long time ago where the person running the company insisted on everything going through them - whether it was important decisions like strategy or minor stuff like approving the purchase of paper clips!</description>

      <description>I read a lot of books and once I start reading a book I normally finish it. This article proposes that it may be more valuable to have a bunch of books that are unread. Not sure I completely buy in to the proposition that &amp;ldquo;Read books are far less valuable than unread ones&amp;rdquo; however maybe I won&amp;rsquo;t feel so guilty buying a book and then leaving it unread.

      <description>I am back on the learning Scala trail and it is clear that just reading books and articles or watching videos won&amp;rsquo;t cut it. It needs to be hands-on coding.
This article highlights that some skills cannot be learnt without actual doing.

      <description>This is a very simple idea for a quiz. It drops you in a random place somewhere in the world and you use Google StreetView to work out where it is. If you are lucky you end up in a town or city, sometimes you end up in the middle of nowhere. It is amazing how much you can work out by looking at the flora or a random signpost.</description>

      <description>A simple change in message can lead to a big impact.
Without changing the price of the drink, the University of Winchester reduced the number of disposal cups used in a year by 34K. This was achieved by saying there was a &amp;ldquo;25p penalty&amp;rdquo; for using a disposable cup rather than a &amp;ldquo;25p discount&amp;rdquo; for using a reusable one.

      <description>There is a video of a demonstration given by Doug Engelbart in 1968 which is commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;The Mother Of All Demos&amp;rdquo;. In the demo, he demonstrates a lot of technologies for the first time together that are common place today and some which we haven&amp;rsquo;t even achieved properly now:
 windows hypertext graphics efficient navigation and command input video conferencing the computer mouse word processing dynamic file linking revision control collaborative real-time editor (collaborative work)  One of the demonstrations that is particularly of interest to me is the chorded keyboard.</description>

The payment was made two weeks ago but never turned up in my account. After numerous phone calls with my bank and a lot of help from the CFO of the company I am working for (thanks Mario) we eventually managed to locate the payment.</description>

      <description>I am probably like most people in that when I meet someone who I deem to be important the way I deal with them changes. It introduces a more reserved interaction with more careful responses.
It is something I am improving. I am now dealing with &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; level executives which in the past would have put me much more on the back foot.
Derek Sivers has written about a chat he had where he really clicked with someone and only later found out how important he could be to his life - which if he had known previously would have completely changed the way they interacted.</description>

      <description>Derek Sivers highlights an interesting pricing approach in this article. He was asked to perform at a distant location. When the customer couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford the price they suggested reducing the performance time, hoping to reduce the price. Instead of doing the expected he raised his price. His reason was that they were paying for him to get to the location and then do the work where the work was the fun bit.</description>

      <description>I have never formally made a bucket list. Sure, there are things I would love to do and some more than others but I have never written anything down.
This article has a different way of composing this list and the focus is definitely on people. It is basically the following:
&amp;ldquo;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re in a hospital bed, connected to a tube. You have a pen and paper in hand. Would you really list anything about visiting a foreign country or an ocean escapade?</description>
