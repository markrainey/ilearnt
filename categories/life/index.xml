      <title>Learning Without Doing</title>

      <description>I am back on the learning Scala trail and it is clear that just reading books and articles or watching videos won&amp;rsquo;t cut it. It needs to be hands-on coding.
This article highlights that some skills cannot be learnt without actual doing.

      <description>This is a very simple idea for a quiz. It drops you in a random place somewhere in the world and you use Google StreetView to work out where it is. If you are lucky you end up in a town or city, sometimes you end up in the middle of nowhere. It is amazing how much you can work out by looking at the flora or a random signpost.</description>

      <title>Simple Change = Big Impact</title>

      <description>A simple change in message can lead to a big impact.
Without changing the price of the drink, the University of Winchester reduced the number of disposal cups used in a year by 34K. This was achieved by saying there was a &amp;ldquo;25p penalty&amp;rdquo; for using a disposable cup rather than a &amp;ldquo;25p discount&amp;rdquo; for using a reusable one.

      <description>There is a video of a demonstration given by Doug Engelbart in 1968 which is commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;The Mother Of All Demos&amp;rdquo;. In the demo, he demonstrates a lot of technologies for the first time together that are common place today and some which we haven&amp;rsquo;t even achieved properly now:
 windows hypertext graphics efficient navigation and command input video conferencing the computer mouse word processing dynamic file linking revision control collaborative real-time editor (collaborative work)  One of the demonstrations that is particularly of interest to me is the chorded keyboard.</description>

      <description>A simple chart showing how the English alphabet evolved and how we ended up with what we have. It is particularly interesting how the Roman alphabet changed to become the English alphabet.

      <description>I was due to be paid for some work earlier this month and the payment was from a foreign bank account into my account in GBP. The payment was made two weeks ago but never turned up in my account. After numerous phone calls with my bank and a lot of help from the CFO of the company I am working for (thanks Mario) we eventually managed to locate the payment.</description>

      <description>This page is devoted to maths and in particular pi. The answer to the second question on this page is unexpected and I love the energy the maths teacher brings to the class in the video. I had maths teachers but never one quite like this.

      <title>Don&#39;t Let Status Change The Conversation</title>

      <description>I am probably like most people in that when I meet someone who I deem to be important the way I deal with them changes. It introduces a more reserved interaction with more careful responses.
It is something I am improving. I am now dealing with &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; level executives which in the past would have put me much more on the back foot.
Derek Sivers has written about a chat he had where he really clicked with someone and only later found out how important he could be to his life - which if he had known previously would have completely changed the way they interacted.</description>

      <title>Unexpected pricing</title>

      <description>Derek Sivers highlights an interesting pricing approach in this article. He was asked to perform at a distant location. When the customer couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford the price they suggested reducing the performance time, hoping to reduce the price. Instead of doing the expected he raised his price. His reason was that they were paying for him to get to the location and then do the work where the work was the fun bit.</description>

      <title>The Alternative Bucket List</title>

      <description>I have never formally made a bucket list. Sure, there are things I would love to do and some more than others but I have never written anything down.
This article has a different way of composing this list and the focus is definitely on people. It is basically the following:
&amp;ldquo;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re in a hospital bed, connected to a tube. You have a pen and paper in hand. Would you really list anything about visiting a foreign country or an ocean escapade?</description>

      <title>Technology: Am I past it?</title>

      <description>This is an interesting post from Rob Conery, someone I&amp;rsquo;ve followed for quite some time, and his observations as he gets older about how he wonders if he is past keeping up with new technology.
I regularly get challenged with new roles and new technologies and often question myself but experience counts for a lot and life would be boring without challenges :)
