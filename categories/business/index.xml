      <title>The loosely held product roadmap</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/looselyheldroadmap/</link>

      <description>In a recent article by Ryan Singer, Options, Not Roadmaps, he explains why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t use roadmaps - he uses options instead.
The use of a roadmap implies a set of features that will be developed in order. A decision is made at a point in time about the features to develop, how long they will take and the order they will be done.
At the beginning when the roadmap is made there is incomplete information.</description>

      <title>New ways to generate ideas online</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/betterideaprompts/</link>

      <description>There are a lot of sites that claim to be idea generators. Most of them turn out to be just a button you click that slings together a bunch of random words that are meant to then become a prompt to generate ideas.
The Product Idea Prompts site by Jakob Greenfeld seems to be much more than this. The prompts it generates are not random words but calls to action - tasks to do that will then generate ideas.</description>

      <title>Rethinking conferences in a remote only world</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/rethinkingconferences/</link>

      <description>I recently attended the fully virtual Microsoft Build conference. There is no way I would have been able to attend the real &amp;ldquo;physical&amp;rdquo; conference due to the location, financial commitment and time required however this gave me an opportunity to benefit from something normally out of my reach.
The conference as a whole was excellent despite the limitations of not only being virtual but also mostly broadcast from homes. The idea of running each talk multiple times to suit people in different time zones was brilliant and the variety of subjects and presentation styles was great.</description>

      <description>I came across an excellent site for summaries of productivity books. There are a lot of sites out there that provide summaries however the quality of the video summaries is excellent and seems to be updated fairly frequently.

      <title>Tackle the difficult problems first with #MonkeyFirst</title>

      <description>I was listening to the audiobook for &amp;ldquo;Questions Are the Answer&amp;rdquo; by Hal Gregerson and it mentioned an approach used by the X lab at Alphabet nicknamed &amp;ldquo;MonkeyFirst&amp;rdquo;.
It talks about the hypothetical problem of getting a monkey to recite passages of Shakespeare while sitting at the top of a 10 foot pedestal. There is a natural tendency to start working on the pedestal. It is something we know how to do and would show progress.</description>

      <description>These are my notes from attending the Consensus 2019 conference in New York - there is a good chance that some of the notes I made are incorrect.

      <title>Empowering problem solvers - not offering solutions</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/empoweringproblemsolvers/</link>

      <guid>https://ilearnt.com/post/empoweringproblemsolvers/</guid>
      <description>There is a natural reaction for people when faced with a problem to offer solutions. This can be especially true for managers.
The article linked below highlights this and offers an alternative approach to the situation where an employee approaches their manager with a problem. A lot of managers will immediately jump into problem solving mode and propose one or more solutions to the problem. It proposes that the role of the manager is not to solve problems, as that is what the employee was effectively employed to do, but to help others solve problems.</description>

      <title>The battle of real versus artificial deadlines</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/deadlinetypes/</link>

      <guid>https://ilearnt.com/post/deadlinetypes/</guid>
      <description>This excellent article looks at the different types of deadlines and the impact they have. The key point for me, and not something I had seen previously defined, is the distinction between real and artificial deadlines:
 Real deadlines have a direct (and often large) economic consequence. Not meeting the deadline will seriously jeopardize some future outcome. Artificial deadlines don’t work like that. There may be an economic impact, but the link between “hitting the date” and the economic impact will be a lot more subtle and abstract.</description>

      <title>From 5 whys to why now?</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/whynow/</link>

      <guid>https://ilearnt.com/post/whynow/</guid>
      <description>I have used the &amp;ldquo;5 whys&amp;rdquo; approach multiple times to get to the root of some question. This article advocates adding a time dimension to the decision. Not only should we consider why we are doing something, we should also consider why we are doing something at a specific point in time. It also twists this around and suggests we should consider &amp;ldquo;What is the danger of not doing this right now?</description>

      <title>How to identify real gurus and experts</title>

      <description>This is an old post (March 2009) that someone retweeted but still holds true on how to work out if an expert is really an expert. It also is a guide how not to fall into common traps that so-called experts fall into.

      <title>The unseen impact of the little trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/thelittletradeoffs/</link>

      <guid>https://ilearnt.com/post/thelittletradeoffs/</guid>
      <description>I found this article to be a very astute observation that it can be all the &amp;ldquo;little trade-offs&amp;rdquo; that can add up to cause issues. The article highlights it from the perspective of a leader who can make small decisions, usually around putting something off or taking a short cut, that can add up to impact their work and those around them.
I have also seen this with technical projects. Sometimes small decisions can cascade through a project and cause massive problems later.</description>

      <title>Using crazy socks to make an impact</title>

      <description>This is a great article about a small business that is growing rapidly and run with a smile on their faces. John and his dad started a business to sell crazy, fun socks and it has gone from strength to strength. I also like the 5% of sales to the Special Olympics and the socks for charities (watch the video).
Oh and John has Down&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome - an amazing family!</description>

      <title>Surprising the customer with unexpected pricing</title>

      <guid>https://ilearnt.com/post/unexpectedpricing/</guid>
      <description>Derek Sivers highlights an interesting pricing approach in this article. He was asked to perform at a distant location. When the customer couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford the price they suggested reducing the performance time, hoping to reduce the price. Instead of doing the expected he raised his price. His reason was that they were paying for him to get to the location and then do the work where the work was the fun bit.</description>

      <title>Knowledge workers are assets not costs</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/knowledgeworkers/</link>

      <guid>https://ilearnt.com/post/knowledgeworkers/</guid>
      <description>This is an excellent article that touches on some many areas including Amazon (again) and their structure. However the most interesting part for me is the section on the way to view knowledge workers in business:
“Knowledge-worker productivity requires that the knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an ‘asset’ rather than a ‘cost.’ It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities.</description>

      <description>I came across a link on Product Hunt to Tailor Brands who do automatic logo creation and branding. It is great to see them still doing well. I used them for my company logo, Sentio Ventures, shortly after they started in 2014!

      <title>Could Amazon revolutionize the shopping experience?</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/amazonshop/</link>

      <guid>https://ilearnt.com/post/amazonshop/</guid>
      <description>Amazon just opened the first store with no cashiers or checkouts.
Using technology it has been able to do away with both of these traditional aspects of a shop and just let customers walk out, having worked out what they have purchased.
Will it revolutionize shopping? I am not sure in the short term as this is some quite impressive technology and I am not sure it scales to a normal shop or supermarket however it has the potential to really shake things up over time - or at least push the incumbent shops to think again.</description>
