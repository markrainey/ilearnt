      <title>Smart glasses you might actually wear</title>

      <description>Intel have just announced a new set of smart glasses that don&amp;rsquo;t look stupid. Admittedly the functionality is a lot more limited that other offerings however these look a lot more normal than them. It provides very limited functionality to display a small red image in the lower part of the wearers vision. Cleverly it also disappears when the user is not looking down.
They have some grand plans for it but I do question whether the limited display provides enough functionality to get users to use it.</description>

      <title>TP-Link RE650</title>

      <description>I had a very unusual setup for the network for my office. The office is situated a floor above and at the opposite end of the house to where the main router is located. A fully wired connection is not an option at the moment due to concrete floors and limited access to roof voids.
Previously this meant using a wireless extender into the room above the router and then using HomePlugs to connect to the office.</description>

      <title>Professionals v Amateurs</title>

      <description>This article defines the difference between a professional developer and an amateur as:
A professional always does everything necessary to complete a job. An amateur sometimes chooses only the fun parts.
It goes on further to say that the amateur only codes what they have been told; the professional bring &amp;ldquo;their full brain, experience and creativity&amp;rdquo;. To be professional is to go the extra mile, think about the work and deliver something that delivers what is needed (which is not necessarily what has been defined).</description>

      <title>Technology: Am I past it?</title>

      <description>This is an interesting post from Rob Conery, someone I&amp;rsquo;ve followed for quite some time, and his observations as he gets older about how he wonders if he is past keeping up with new technology.
I regularly get challenged with new roles and new technologies and often question myself but experience counts for a lot and life would be boring without challenges :)

      <title>Getting started with the Hugo static site generator</title>
      <link>https://ilearnt.com/post/hugo/</link>

      <description>This blog is being powered by a static content generator called Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. Getting Hugo up and running was relatively easy. Download the relevant version and installation was just copying it to a folder.
Once installed, create a new site:
â€‹ hugo new site mySite
In the site folder edit the config.toml file to change the baseUrl, the language and the title.
Use git to clone a theme from the available themes to a folder under the themes folder in your site.</description>
