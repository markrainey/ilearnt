      <description>I am currently starting to learn Scala (to add to a myriad of other languages I have programmed in over my career). We are also in the process of &amp;ldquo;dockerizing&amp;rdquo; our application. So I wanted to try for myself getting a simple Scala application running in Docker.
This page has a very simple guide to getting a &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; application up and running.

      <description>I have worked with various flavours of &amp;ldquo;Agile&amp;rdquo; over numerous years. These have ranged from the very formal where everything is done by the book to more ad-hoc versions where different parts are cherry picked or in most cases done because people think they should be done.
What is clear is that &amp;ldquo;Agile&amp;rdquo; has become more about the processes than about the results and the actual aims of the original manifesto.</description>

      <description>This paper is a discussion around the issues faced by distributed systems when dealing with time, ordering and failures. This is particularly relevant with the work I am doing at the moment designing a very large distributed system that will need to scale massively.
It is remarkably readable and illustrates key issues and limitations in the field. It has already got me researching other areas mentioned in the paper.

      <description>This is a summary of a number of consensus algorithms currently being used in the Blockchain space. The most common at the moment is Proof of Work however this is slowly being replaced by other approaches that are more performant and don&amp;rsquo;t use all the Earth&amp;rsquo;s energy.

      <description>There are some amazing things happening with image processing at the moment. I remember my graphics class at university 25 years ago and the primitive, by comparison to now, image processing algorithms we had to code. Oh how things have moved on.
The first link below is some incredible work to make very low light images intelligible. The example results are quite incredible - making a viewable image out of an image that looks completely dark.</description>

      <title>MacBook touchscreen for $1</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t own, and have no intention of owning, a MacBook as I own a touchscreen Windows laptop however this approach to make it support touch is genius. They use a mirror at the top of the screen and some image processing to work out where the finger is. They can determine if the finger is actually touching the screen by whether it is touching its reflection - very clever lateral thinking.</description>

      <description>It is very easy to make assumptions about a subject you know well and others may not. You will have knowledge you have learnt over time that you perceive is so simple or obvious that others should just know it - forgetting that once you too had to learn it. This article sums it up really well with the word &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>There seems to be no single clean definition of what &amp;ldquo;Blockchain&amp;rdquo; actually means. There are a lot of woolly statements, several of which are clearly either wrong or too narrowly focused. This article goes into some of the different definitions and why they are wrong and then the implications of this from a business but also a legal perspective.
I personally think the definition by Mike Gault, CEO of Guardtime, is the closest:</description>

      <description>Ubissoft have introduced a tool that &amp;ldquo;uses AI&amp;rdquo; to identify potential coding issues when the developer commits code. They claim it can detect a significant number of errors and even suggest solutions in some cases. There will always be some errors that it will not be able to identify, for example where the implementation doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the requirements, however this approach could have a significant impact on the amount of time spent debugging.</description>

      <description>This is an excellent study on why developers are so important to a platform. At the moment we are developing a platform and we have been trying to get this message across to the business side of the company. This article backs up what we have been saying.
 &amp;ldquo;This means that platform makers must listen and learn how developers want their platforms marketed to them and must work to help developers find interesting ways to solve tough problems using their platforms, he added.</description>

      <description>This was an excellent podcast on the ethics behind some of the decisions being made about technology today. The whole talk is excellent and thought provoking however for me one part (about 27 minutes in) stood out:
&amp;ldquo;When we think about AI we have to remember you know when you point the AI system at chess, right, first it kind of wiggles around and it makes some kind of funny looking moves and then it starts making some smart moves as it gets better and then it makes some surprisingly smart moves and then it beats Garry Kasparov.</description>

      <description>Intel have just announced a new set of smart glasses that don&amp;rsquo;t look stupid. Admittedly the functionality is a lot more limited that other offerings however these look a lot more normal than them. It provides very limited functionality to display a small red image in the lower part of the wearers vision. Cleverly it also disappears when the user is not looking down.
They have some grand plans for it but I do question whether the limited display provides enough functionality to get users to use it.</description>

      <description>I had a very unusual setup for the network for my office. The office is situated a floor above and at the opposite end of the house to where the main router is located. A fully wired connection is not an option at the moment due to concrete floors and limited access to roof voids.
Previously this meant using a wireless extender into the room above the router and then using HomePlugs to connect to the office.</description>

      <description>This article defines the difference between a professional developer and an amateur as:
A professional always does everything necessary to complete a job. An amateur sometimes chooses only the fun parts.
It goes on further to say that the amateur only codes what they have been told; the professional bring &amp;ldquo;their full brain, experience and creativity&amp;rdquo;. To be professional is to go the extra mile, think about the work and deliver something that delivers what is needed (which is not necessarily what has been defined).</description>

I regularly get challenged with new roles and new technologies and often question myself but experience counts for a lot and life would be boring without challenges :)

      <description>This blog is being powered by a static content generator called Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. Getting Hugo up and running was relatively easy. Download the relevant version and installation was just copying it to a folder.
Once installed, create a new site:
​ hugo new site mySite
In the site folder edit the config.toml file to change the baseUrl, the language and the title.
Use git to clone a theme from the available themes to a folder under the themes folder in your site.</description>
