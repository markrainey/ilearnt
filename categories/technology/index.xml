      <description>This is an interesting post from Rob Conery, someone I&amp;rsquo;ve followed for quite some time, and his observations as he gets older about how he wonders if he is past keeping up with new technology.

I regularly get challenged with new roles and new technologies and often question myself but experience counts for a lot and life would be boring without challenges :)</description>

      <title>Getting started with the Hugo static site generator</title>
      <link>https://markrainey.github.io/ilearnt/post/hugo/</link>

      <description>This blog is being powered by a static content generator called Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. Getting Hugo up and running was relatively easy. Download the relevant version and installation was just copying it to a folder.
Once installed, create a new site:
â€‹ hugo new site mySite
In the site folder edit the config.toml file to change the baseUrl, the language and the title.
Use git to clone a theme from the available themes to a folder under the themes folder in your site.</description>
