    <p>I was really looking forward to this book as I had listened to a podcast where they explained the ideas behind it. The two authors run a design course in Stanford that gets massively oversubscribed and has a huge impact on those who take it by looking at life as a design problem. The aim is to come up with lots of possible routes for your life that could be awesome and then design a path to achieve one of them. If that doesn&rsquo;t work you can use the same approach to look for new opportunities. I have not yet made the time to do the exercises and these are absolutely key to getting the most out of it.</p>

<p>I would recommend this book and would probably recommend it even more if I had been through the exercises. I plan to start them once my new role has calmed down a little and I have time to take a step back and look at life.</p>
