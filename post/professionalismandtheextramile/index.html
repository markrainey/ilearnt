    <p>We had been planning to have a large garden summerhouse built for a number of months and we were finally in a position to do so. After a lot of research we decided to engage a local company as we liked the style of building they produced and the price was also competitive.</p>
<p>Once things were ready to start, we were told to be ready for the builders to turn up at 7:45 in the morning. We were surprised when they actually turned up closer to 7:15 (after nearly an hour’s drive to get to us) and then waited in the van; and they did this every day of the week long build.</p>
<p>The professionalism of these three builders was exceptional. Not only were they always punctual, their attention to detail and the effort they put into their work was amazing.</p>
<p>The first thing they would do in the morning was to put down boards so they didn&rsquo;t damage the lawn and only then would they bring in their equipment. At the end of the day, even though it was dark, they would sweep up and clear up all the rubbish - and this was despite no-one seeing it before they started the next day.</p>
<p>When they were building they were constantly checking their work over and over to ensure things were level or completely aligned. Even putting on a series of small panels above the door took about 3 to 4 hours just due to their attention to detail.</p>
<p>So, Stefan, Johnny and Tony I salute you and thank you for your hard work, your skill and the exceptional professionalism you demonstrated.</p>
