    <p>Someone I work with mentioned that each week he takes time to have coffee with his mum. This might sound quite normal but there are two parts that stand out for me.</p>
<p>Firstly it is the actual act of scheduling time to do this. It is very easy in today&rsquo;s world to get so busy that we forget about the important stuff. Secondly, he lives in London and his mum lives in South Africa. One morning each week they both jump on a video call and just have a coffee &ldquo;together&rdquo; and a chat.</p>
<p>At the moment, we have just started the first steps of isolation relating to the COVID 19 virus. My parents live about 250 miles away in Devon and it looks like they will be in isolation for about 3-4 months even though they are both active and relatively healthy.</p>
<p>On Sunday we are planning a family breakfast. We will be using Google Meet and we will all be joining - us, my parents, my brother in Chippenham and my cousin in Liverpool. It is such a simple thing to do and I think we will find it will bring us even closer together - despite the distance.</p>
<p>Thanks Gerhard for the idea!</p>
