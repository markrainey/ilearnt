    <p>It is very easy for your work week to become a random collection of meetings - all with different attendees and different agendas. For developers in particular this can cause a huge hit on productivity as their day becomes disjointed and they are unable to stay focussed for the longer periods they need for their work.</p>
<p>We started seeing this with the team I am working with. Someone would see a big chunk of free time and schedule a meeting right in the middle of it. It started to feel like everything was revolving around meetings and workshops - and delivery noticeably dropped.</p>
<p>We are about to try having &ldquo;meeting free&rdquo; days. Tuesday and Thursday have been set aside as meeting free - unless someone has an exceptionally good reason to break that rule. The team have bought into this and we will see how it goes.</p>
