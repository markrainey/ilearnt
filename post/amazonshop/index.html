    <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/amazon-just-made-a-huge-announcement-that-will-completely-change-future-of-shopping.html">Amazon just opened the first store with no cashiers or checkouts.</a></p>

<p>Using technology it has been able to do away with both of these traditional aspects of a shop and just let customers walk out, having worked out what they have purchased.</p>

<p>Will it revolutionize shopping? I am not sure in the short term as this is some quite impressive technology and I am not sure it scales to a normal shop or supermarket however it has the potential to really shake things up over time - or at least push the incumbent shops to think again.</p>

<p><strong>[Update]</strong> Ben Thompson (I love his analysis) has an <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/amazons-go-and-the-future/">interesting view</a> that Amazon won&rsquo;t license this approach, at least initially, and will use it to build a bigger gap between itself and other retailers. It also highlights why Amazon is such an unusual company in its approach to business and the way it grows.</p>
