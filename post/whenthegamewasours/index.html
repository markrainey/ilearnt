    <p>On 12th June 1984 I was on a family holiday in the US. We had spent three weeks travelling around Florida and then up the east coast to finally end up in Boston. During the day we had a guided tour of the city and we were told that it was game seven of the NBA finals that night between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<p>I was only thirteen but, possibly as it was the last night of the holiday, managed to persuade my parents that I could stay up and watch the game. My mum and I stayed up late into the night watching Boston beat the Lakers. Despite being in Boston, for some reason I decided to support the Lakers and Magic Johnson became one of my heroes.</p>
<p>This book is all about the two main protagonists of that game. It is brilliantly written and covers their rivalry and eventual friendship. I knew quite a lot about Magic but very little about Larry (he&rsquo;s meant to be the enemy right?). It highlights how driven they both were and also how they stood so far ahead of their peers. It highlights that a lot of the success of the NBA today is down to them.</p>
<p>The book interweaves their stories incredibly well and really captures the battles they had together. And due to these battles it covers both their highs and their lows. It is a shame both their careers were impacted by health issues - Magic and HIV, and Larry and his back problems.</p>
<p>I came away with a new admiration, not just for Magic, but also for Larry - something I wasn&rsquo;t expecting. I guess that is a sign of how good this book is.</p>
