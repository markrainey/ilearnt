    <p>I read a lot of books - a bit less at the moment as I commute less - but still probably more than most people. However there are so many books I would like to read I can&rsquo;t read them all. I still prefer to read the full book but sometimes book summaries are useful - either to get the key concepts or as a reminder of what I have previously read.</p>
<p>I have a subscription to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a> which has started providing book summaries. It also comes with a free subscription to <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">Blinkist</a>.</p>
<p>However there are also some free sites where people have summarised books.</p>
<p>I have been reading the summaries by <a href="https://sivers.org/book">Derek Sivers</a> for years. As well as providing a summary he also gives the books a score - I don&rsquo;t always agree with them but they provide a good initial guide. I also like you can sort them by &ldquo;newest&rdquo; so you can see what has been added since your last visit.</p>
<p>I recently came across <a href="http://blas.com/">The Rabbit Hole</a>. This has a huge number of summaries for a single person. Each summary is organised into an overall summary, key takeaways and a &ldquo;What I got out of it section&rdquo;.</p>
