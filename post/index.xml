      <description>This blog is being powered by a static content generator called Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. Getting Hugo up and running was relatively easy. Download the relevant version and installation was just copying it to a folder.
Once installed, create a new site:
â€‹ hugo new site mySite
In the site folder edit the config.toml file to change the baseUrl, the language and the title.
Use git to clone a theme from the available themes to a folder under the themes folder in your site.</description>
