    <p>We have a lot of remote meetings as most of our team work a significant amount of time from home. Face to face meetings are much better for some types of meetings - especially workshops and retrospectives. As the level of expected collaboration increases the more it favours face to face interactions.</p>
<p>We have also been far from optimal in capturing information from meetings and discussions. We have tended to capture the actions fairly well but have failed to adequately capture the &ldquo;why&rdquo; - i.e. why were certain decisions made or approaches followed.</p>
<p>We had a recent meeting where we all collaborated on a shared Google doc as the meeting progressed. This worked really well for this particular meeting. We have decided that for nearly all meetings we will create a shared document with an expectation that all participants will update it as it progresses. I would expect there will be a need in each meeting for someone to &ldquo;own&rdquo; it so that things don&rsquo;t fall through the gaps and I would also expect that role to be rotated. Any information captured is better than nothing.</p>
