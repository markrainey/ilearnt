          <p>In a recent article by Ryan Singer, Options, Not Roadmaps, he explains why he doesn&rsquo;t use roadmaps - he uses options instead.
The use of a roadmap implies a set of features that will be developed in order. A decision is made at a point in time about the features to develop, how long they will take and the order they will be done.
At the beginning when the roadmap is made there is incomplete information.</p>

          <p>There are a lot of sites that claim to be idea generators. Most of them turn out to be just a button you click that slings together a bunch of random words that are meant to then become a prompt to generate ideas.
The Product Idea Prompts site by Jakob Greenfeld seems to be much more than this. The prompts it generates are not random words but calls to action - tasks to do that will then generate ideas.</p>

          <p>Sometimes it is very easy to buy things just for the sake of it. We get that rush when either we bring the item home or it is delivered. It is easy to form an addiction to that feeling.
When the sales come around we might see something on offer that we think we would like - but had probably not considered before - and this is the time to take a step back and consider whether we really need it.</p>

          <p>I was recently reminded of this great quote:
&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.&rdquo; - R. Buckminster Fuller
Sometimes this happens when working in the world of software.
There have been occasions where I have been working on a design and the solution just seems to fall out almost naturally - and in most cases where this has happened the beauty becomes apparent in the ease and clarity that the approach can be built on and extended.</p>

          <p>At the startup I work for we used to have a full time HR person. These were in the days when the expectation was that we would have explosive growth and the company would &ldquo;at least double in size every few months&rdquo;. Unfortunately that is not the way it played out - we are still making good progress but have much more realistic growth plans.
And over time we realised that a full time HR person was overkill for the size of company we were so it was decided to scale down the role - a real shame as he was a really good guy and good at his job.</p>
