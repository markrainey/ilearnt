            <p>I read a lot of books and once I start reading a book I normally finish it. This article proposes that it may be more valuable to have a bunch of books that are unread. Not sure I completely buy in to the proposition that &ldquo;Read books are far less valuable than unread ones&rdquo; however maybe I won&rsquo;t feel so guilty buying a book and then leaving it unread.

            <p>I am back on the learning Scala trail and it is clear that just reading books and articles or watching videos won&rsquo;t cut it. It needs to be hands-on coding.
This article highlights that some skills cannot be learnt without actual doing.

            <p>I am currently starting to learn Scala (to add to a myriad of other languages I have programmed in over my career). We are also in the process of &ldquo;dockerizing&rdquo; our application. So I wanted to try for myself getting a simple Scala application running in Docker.
This page has a very simple guide to getting a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application up and running.

            <p>I have worked with various flavours of &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; over numerous years. These have ranged from the very formal where everything is done by the book to more ad-hoc versions where different parts are cherry picked or in most cases done because people think they should be done.
What is clear is that &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; has become more about the processes than about the results and the actual aims of the original manifesto.</p>

            <p>I have never been a fan of performance reviews. It may have been down to the way they were implemented at the places I worked however they never seemed to achieve what they were set out to do. The review would usually consist of going over the &ldquo;achievements&rdquo; for the past period and then setting a bunch of artificial goals for the next period. The only time these new goals were actually consulted was in the run up to the next review.</p>

            <p>This is a very simple idea for a quiz. It drops you in a random place somewhere in the world and you use Google StreetView to work out where it is. If you are lucky you end up in a town or city, sometimes you end up in the middle of nowhere. It is amazing how much you can work out by looking at the flora or a random signpost.</p>
