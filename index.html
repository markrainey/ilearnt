            <p>I have tried numerous to-do applications in the past; from the very simplest to the all-singing, all-dancing applications and they have never stuck. I used them for a week or so and realised a month later that I hadn&rsquo;t used them for a while.
The Microsoft To Do application seems to have hit a sweet spot for me. I have found myself using it regularly to track both my home and my work tasks.</p>

            <p>I came across an excellent site for summaries of productivity books. There are a lot of sites out there that provide summaries however the quality of the video summaries is excellent and seems to be updated fairly frequently.

            <p>It is very easy for your work week to become a random collection of meetings - all with different attendees and different agendas. For developers in particular this can cause a huge hit on productivity as their day becomes disjointed and they are unable to stay focussed for the longer periods they need for their work.
We started seeing this with the team I am working with. Someone would see a big chunk of free time and schedule a meeting right in the middle of it.</p>

            <p>We have a lot of remote meetings as most of our team work a significant amount of time from home. Face to face meetings are much better for some types of meetings - especially workshops and retrospectives. As the level of expected collaboration increases the more it favours face to face interactions.
We have also been far from optimal in capturing information from meetings and discussions. We have tended to capture the actions fairly well but have failed to adequately capture the &ldquo;why&rdquo; - i.</p>

            <p>On most projects there is a tendency for someone involved to become the &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in one or more areas. As they become comfortable and more knowledgeable in an area they will naturally gravitate to picking up tasks related to it. The need to deliver as quickly as possible can also drive this as the person who knows most is likely to be the person who can do the work quickest.</p>

            <p>Someone I work with mentioned that each week he takes time to have coffee with his mum. This might sound quite normal but there are two parts that stand out for me.
Firstly it is the actual act of scheduling time to do this. It is very easy in today&rsquo;s world to get so busy that we forget about the important stuff. Secondly, he lives in London and his mum lives in South Africa.</p>

            <p>This short clip is pretty remarkable. A young woman lost most of her sight due to a brain tumour. All she has left is a small blurry circle in her right eye. With the use of some AR goggles and some very clever tech she was able to read for the first time in years - very moving.

            <p>This is one of the scariest videos I think I have ever seen. It is not a horror movie or a thriller - it is a talk about the impact sleep has on the body and in particular the impact a lack of sleep has. This includes increasing the risk of cancer, decreased brain function and reduced immune system. I am seriously reconsidering how I &ldquo;do&rdquo; sleep after watching this!</p>
