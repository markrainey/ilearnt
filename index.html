            <p>Someone I work with mentioned that each week he takes time to have coffee with his mum. This might sound quite normal but there are two parts that stand out for me.
Firstly it is the actual act of scheduling time to do this. It is very easy in today&rsquo;s world to get so busy that we forget about the important stuff. Secondly, he lives in London and his mum lives in South Africa.</p>

            <p>This short clip is pretty remarkable. A young woman lost most of her sight due to a brain tumour. All she has left is a small blurry circle in her right eye. With the use of some AR goggles and some very clever tech she was able to read for the first time in years - very moving.

            <p>This is one of the scariest videos I think I have ever seen. It is not a horror movie or a thriller - it is a talk about the impact sleep has on the body and in particular the impact a lack of sleep has. This includes increasing the risk of cancer, decreased brain function and reduced immune system. I am seriously reconsidering how I &ldquo;do&rdquo; sleep after watching this!</p>

            <p>I read a lot of books - a bit less at the moment as I commute less - but still probably more than most people. However there are so many books I would like to read I can&rsquo;t read them all. I still prefer to read the full book but sometimes book summaries are useful - either to get the key concepts or as a reminder of what I have previously read.</p>

            <p>I was listening to the audiobook for &ldquo;Questions Are the Answer&rdquo; by Hal Gregerson and it mentioned an approach used by the X lab at Alphabet nicknamed &ldquo;MonkeyFirst&rdquo;.
It talks about the hypothetical problem of getting a monkey to recite passages of Shakespeare while sitting at the top of a 10 foot pedestal. There is a natural tendency to start working on the pedestal. It is something we know how to do and would show progress.</p>

            <p>There is often a work culture that you should be busy all the time - if you are a programmer you should always be typing and producing code. Programming is a mental process and so requires thinking. Sometimes a little thought upfront saves a lot of pain and work down the line.
The article below has a potentially controversial headline but sums this up really well. Being perceived as lazy as a programmer can actually be a good thing.</p>

            <p>I really like Seth Godin&rsquo;s blog - I could easily link to his posts every day - however occasionally a post really stands out for me. A recent post called Bottlenecks had an interesting observation that was a different way of thinking about them.
I worked for a company a long time ago where the person running the company insisted on everything going through them - whether it was important decisions like strategy or minor stuff like approving the purchase of paper clips!</p>

            <p>This article uses a really neat analogy with Tetris for illustrating the impact of technical debt. Leaving gaps is akin to leaving technical debt in the code base and makes subsequent changes more difficult or slower to ship.
 A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt.
 It also points out the fact that it is called debt and so has to be paid off at some point.
 Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive.</p>
