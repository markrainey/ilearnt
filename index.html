          <p>At the startup I work for we used to have a full time HR person. These were in the days when the expectation was that we would have explosive growth and the company would &ldquo;at least double in size every few months&rdquo;. Unfortunately that is not the way it played out - we are still making good progress but have much more realistic growth plans.
And over time we realised that a full time HR person was overkill for the size of company we were so it was decided to scale down the role - a real shame as he was a really good guy and good at his job.</p>

          <p>There is a famous quote that asks how you eat an elephant and the answer is one bite at a time. It can be very daunting when attempting something new especially if it is potentially a large task. However it is impossible if you don&rsquo;t take the first step.
(By the way, I am not advocating eating elephants - just to be clear)
Seth Godin wrote an article recently called &ldquo;The 100 hour asset&quot;.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cherrie is the pastor of Home Church. In a recent sermon entitled &ldquo;7 lessons from 7 years at Home Church&rdquo; he gave the following quote:
The culture is shaped by the worst behaviour the leader is willing to accept
He was particularly referencing the church however it is much broader than this.
This observation has certainly shown to be the case where I have worked. Without wanting to incriminate myself, there have been some questionable decisions made by the management in the past which have meant it has been very difficult to hold others accountable for their later actions when a precedence has been set.</p>

          <p>There was a tweet recently by Sahil Lavingia that stated
&ldquo;Great ideas come from two places: solitude and conversation.&quot;
I have certainly found this to be the case.
When I was commuting into London every day I would regularly spend 30 minutes walking back from the train station. During this time I would either listen to podcasts - all sorts of subjects - or just use the time to think. This led to a whole bunch of ideas around work or potential projects or just interesting avenues to follow.</p>

          <p>Due to the ongoing COVID situation the team had been struggling to stay focussed and motivated. The inability to go out, the lack of change of scenery and the sameness every day has been taking its toll. To try to address this we actively encouraged them to take time off - which, given the limitations on travel, was less appealing than it normally would be.
For those unable or unwilling to take time off we decided to introduce a &ldquo;fallow week&rdquo;.</p>
