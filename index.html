            <p>I am currently starting to learn Scala (to add to a myriad of other languages I have programmed in over my career). We are also in the process of &ldquo;dockerizing&rdquo; our application. So I wanted to try for myself getting a simple Scala application running in Docker.
This page has a very simple guide to getting a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application up and running.

            <p>I have worked with various flavours of &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; over numerous years. These have ranged from the very formal where everything is done by the book to more ad-hoc versions where different parts are cherry picked or in most cases done because people think they should be done.
What is clear is that &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; has become more about the processes than about the results and the actual aims of the original manifesto.</p>

            <p>I have never been a fan of performance reviews. It may have been down to the way they were implemented at the places I worked however they never seemed to achieve what they were set out to do. The review would usually consist of going over the &ldquo;achievements&rdquo; for the past period and then setting a bunch of artificial goals for the next period. The only time these new goals were actually consulted was in the run up to the next review.</p>

            <p>This is a very simple idea for a quiz. It drops you in a random place somewhere in the world and you use Google StreetView to work out where it is. If you are lucky you end up in a town or city, sometimes you end up in the middle of nowhere. It is amazing how much you can work out by looking at the flora or a random signpost.</p>

            <p>A simple change in message can lead to a big impact.
Without changing the price of the drink, the University of Winchester reduced the number of disposal cups used in a year by 34K. This was achieved by saying there was a &ldquo;25p penalty&rdquo; for using a disposable cup rather than a &ldquo;25p discount&rdquo; for using a reusable one.

            <p>This paper is a discussion around the issues faced by distributed systems when dealing with time, ordering and failures. This is particularly relevant with the work I am doing at the moment designing a very large distributed system that will need to scale massively.
It is remarkably readable and illustrates key issues and limitations in the field. It has already got me researching other areas mentioned in the paper.

            <p>This is a summary of a number of consensus algorithms currently being used in the Blockchain space. The most common at the moment is Proof of Work however this is slowly being replaced by other approaches that are more performant and don&rsquo;t use all the Earth&rsquo;s energy.

            <p>There are some amazing things happening with image processing at the moment. I remember my graphics class at university 25 years ago and the primitive, by comparison to now, image processing algorithms we had to code. Oh how things have moved on.
The first link below is some incredible work to make very low light images intelligible. The example results are quite incredible - making a viewable image out of an image that looks completely dark.</p>
